# 📋 How to Paste Code (Simple!)

## ✅ EASIEST METHOD - Use Ctrl+V

The green button has clipboard permission issues in some browsers. **Just use the keyboard shortcut instead!**

---

## 🎯 Complete Workflow (Updated)

### Step 1: Capture & Copy from Extension
```
1. Chrome extension → Start Capture → Click element
2. Extension popup → Click capture in "Recent Captures"
3. ✅ "React code copied to clipboard!"
```

### Step 2: Paste into Canvas
```
Option 1 (BEST): Press Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V on Mac)
Option 2: Click anywhere on canvas, then Ctrl+V
```

**That's it!** ✨

## 💡 Why Not the Green Button?

The green button tries to read your clipboard programmatically, which requires special browser permissions. 

**The keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+V) always works** because it's a native browser feature!

## 🚀 Quick Test

### Test the Paste Feature:

1. **Copy this test code:**

}
```

2. **Go to canvas**

3. **Press Ctrl+V** (or Cmd+V)

4. **✅ Component appears!**

## 🎯 Both Methods Work!

| Method | Works? | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Ctrl+V** | ✅ Always | Recommended! |
| Green Button | ⚠️ Sometimes | May need permissions |
| Right-click Paste | ✅ Yes | Also works! |

## 🔧 If Ctrl+V Doesn't Work

### Check These:

1. **Make sure you're not in an input field**
   - Click on empty canvas area first
   - Then press Ctrl+V

2. **Code is actually copied**
   - Extension should say "React code copied!"
   - If not, click the capture again

3. **Canvas is focused**
   - Click anywhere on the canvas
   - You should see the grid
   - Then press Ctrl+V

4. **Check console for errors**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for any red errors
   - Share them if you need help

## 🎨 What Works With Paste

### You Can Paste:

✅ **React Components** - Full JSX code  
✅ **Plain HTML** - Auto-converts to React  
✅ **Extension Captures** - Code from website captures  
✅ **Your Own Code** - Any valid React/JSX  
✅ **Multiple Times** - Same code, different positions  

### Auto-Detection:

The canvas automatically detects:
- React/JSX code
- HTML (converts to React)
- Function components
- Class components
- Code type (react/html/vanilla)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I press Ctrl+V"

**Solution:**
1. Click on the canvas (gray grid area)
2. Make sure you're not in sidebar input/textarea
3. Try clicking empty space, then Ctrl+V

### "Component appears in wrong place"

**Solution:**
- Move mouse to desired location BEFORE pressing Ctrl+V
- Component appears near mouse cursor

### "Says clipboard is empty"

**Solution:**

2. Click the capture again
3. See "React code copied!" message
4. Then Ctrl+V on canvas

### "Code pasted but not rendering"
